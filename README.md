This Python code represents a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using the Turtle graphics library. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food and grow in size while avoiding collisions with the game boundaries and itself.

**Snake Game**
Introduction
This Python script is an implementation of the Snake Game using the Turtle graphics library. The game provides a basic user interface, allowing the player to control the snake's movement and score points by eating food.

**How to Play**
Run the Python script in a compatible environment.
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's movement.
The snake will grow in size when it eats the food.
The game ends if the snake collides with the game boundaries or itself.
Dependencies
The script uses the Turtle graphics library, which is typically included in standard Python installations.

**Controls**
Up: Move the snake up
Down: Move the snake down
Left: Move the snake left
Right: Move the snake right
**Game Logic**
The game continuously updates, moving the snake forward at regular intervals. It checks for collisions with food, game boundaries, and the snake's own tail. The score is displayed on the screen, and the game ends if the snake collides with a boundary or itself.

Customization
Feel free to customize the game by adjusting parameters, such as the sleep duration, collision distances, or the appearance of the snake and food. You can also enhance the game by adding features like levels or obstacles.
